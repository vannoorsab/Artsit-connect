You are an AI assistant helping me build a prototype for an AI-powered artisan marketplace on Replit.

**Goal:**
Create a full-stack web app where local artisans can:
1. Register and log in.
2. Upload product images and descriptions.
3. Get AI-generated suggestions (pricing, captions, marketing text).
4. Display their products on a public marketplace page.
5. Connect with buyers through direct inquiry (later add payments).

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React.js (Vite or Create React App)
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Database/Storage: Firebase or local JSON (for prototype)
- AI: OpenAI API (for text generation, marketing captions, storytelling)
- File upload: Firebase Storage or mock storage in prototype

**Core Features to Build:**
1. **Authentication** (simple artisan login/signup).
2. **Product Upload** (image, description, category, price).
3. **AI Assistant Integration**
   - Suggest product price
   - Generate storytelling captions for social media
   - Suggest SEO-friendly product titles
4. **Marketplace View**
   - Public-facing page with artisan products
   - Search & filter by category
5. **Community/Story Section** (each artisan can share their story powered by AI writing assistance).
6. **Basic Admin Panel** (approve artisans/products if needed).

**High-Level Tasks:**
1. Setup React frontend with product upload form and marketplace display.
2. Setup Express backend with routes:
   - /api/auth
   - /api/products
   - /api/ai (to call OpenAI for captions/pricing)
3. Connect frontend to backend using Axios.
4. Implement AI function that takes product description and returns:
   - Suggested price
   - Marketing caption
   - Short artisan story version
5. Save products and user data in Firebase (or JSON for MVP).
6. Deploy on Replit and test with sample artisan workflows.

**Stretch Goals (optional):**
- Add payment gateway integration (Stripe/Razorpay).
- Add social media auto-posting.
- Add analytics dashboard for artisans.

Start by scaffolding the project structure (frontend + backend folders) and initialize a simple React + Express app connected on Replit.
